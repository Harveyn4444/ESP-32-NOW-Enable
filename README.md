# ESP-32-NOW-Enable
A collection of code testing and creating a system of enabling or disabling the data logging capabilities of my Toucan 2 flight computer
Will start test sending data over ESP 32 to ESP 32
Will use this to turn a state variable on and off, shown by turning an LED red or green, allowing for two way communication
